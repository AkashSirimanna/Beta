# Beta
A social platform that enables individuals to determine the community's sentiment on a stock. Beta doubles as an education platform that teaches trading in a simple and modern manner.

This project was built from scratch with PHP, HTML5 and CSS. Beta is a platform that allows the community to react to a stock. It simplifies sentimental analysis for investors and provides the community with a consensus on how a stock is perceived by the public.

This project leverages wordpress to provide our users with a blog about finance. It is an informal method of learning about fundamental finance and traverses through the basics of economics. From prominent concepts such as risk, to small nuances such as black swan events, this blog acts as an informal way of becoming financially fluent.

Beta's userbase is very small, I hope to gain some momentum through aggresive social media marketing. Beta is a non-profit and was solely built out of interest for trading.
