# Beta
A social platform that enables individuals to determine the community's sentiment on a stock. Beta doubles as an education platform that teaches trading in a simple and modern manner.

This project was built from scratch with PHP, HTML5 and CSS. Beta is a platform that allows the community to react to a stock. It simplifies sentimental analysis for avid investors and provides the community with a consensus on how a stock is perceived by the public.
